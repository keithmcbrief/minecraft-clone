## How to play?

Currently it has 5 types of blocks: Grass, Wood, Log, Glass and Dirt.
You switch blocks with numbers 1-5 on your keyboard.
You navigate the world with the mouse and WASD.
You can click to add blocks and Alt+Click to remove blocks.
You world is stored in your browsers local storage.

PSA: To make sure the crosshair is selecting the appropriate block, make sure the cursor is centered on the crosshair before playing.
